# Kibla App Technical Knowledge Base

## Recent Fixes and Improvements (June 2025)

### 1. Hero Tag Conflicts Resolution
- **Issue**: Multiple FloatingActionButtons were using the default Hero tag, causing navigation errors
- **Fix**: Added unique hero tags to FloatingActionButtons:
  - QiblaScreen: `heroTag: "qibla_calibrate_button"`
  - MosqueScreen: `heroTag: "mosque_add_button"`
- **Technical Details**: In Flutter, Hero widgets must have unique tags within a navigation subtree. When multiple FloatingActionButtons exist across different screens, they need explicit unique tags to avoid conflicts.

### 2. Quran Audio Playback Fixes
- **Issue**: Ayah 2 in Surah Al-Fatiha was being skipped during sequential playback
- **Fix**: Added special handling for Surah Al-Fatiha in the SurahPlaybackController:
  - Implemented retry logic specifically for Ayah 2
  - Increased delay before retry to 2 seconds
  - Added detailed debug logging
- **Technical Details**: The error handling in `_playCurrentAyah()` method was modified to detect Surah 1 (Al-Fatiha) and retry Ayah 2 instead of immediately skipping to the next ayah on error.

### 3. Location Service Improvements
- **Issue**: Location service was returning non-nullable Position objects, causing crashes when location was unavailable
- **Fix**: Modified LocationService to return nullable Position objects and updated all repositories to handle null values:
  - QiblaRepository
  - PrayerRepository
  - MosqueRepository
  - DebugScreen
- **Technical Details**: Added null checks and fallback values in all repositories that consume location data.

### 4. Permission Handling Enhancements
- **Added**: PermissionUtils class for sequential permission requests
- **Improved**: User feedback with rationale dialogs and settings prompts
- **Technical Details**: Uses permission_handler package (v11.4.0) to provide a more robust permission request flow with proper user guidance.

### 5. Error Boundary Improvements
- **Issue**: ErrorBoundary widget was missing required parameters
- **Fix**: Added required `sectionName` parameter to all ErrorBoundary usages
- **Technical Details**: This allows better error isolation and debugging by identifying which section of the app encountered an error.

### 6. Class Naming Conflict Resolution
- **Issue**: Custom Location class conflicted with the Location class from the geocoding package
- **Fix**: Renamed the custom Location class to QiblaLocation
- **Technical Details**: Updated all references to use the new class name and fixed import paths.

## Architecture Notes

### Repository Pattern
The app follows a repository pattern where:
- **Repositories** (QiblaRepository, PrayerRepository, etc.) manage business logic and state
- **Services** (LocationService, CompassService, etc.) handle external interactions
- **Controllers** (SurahPlaybackController) manage complex UI-related logic

### State Management
- Uses Provider package for state management
- Repositories extend ChangeNotifier to provide reactive updates

### Error Handling Strategy
1. Try to handle errors gracefully with fallbacks
2. Provide clear user feedback
3. Use ErrorBoundary widgets to isolate UI errors
4. Log detailed information in debug mode

### Permission Strategy
1. Request permissions when needed, not at app startup
2. Provide clear explanations of why permissions are needed
3. Offer retry options and settings shortcuts
4. Graceful fallbacks when permissions are denied

## Known Issues and Future Improvements

### Known Issues
- Google Maps API key needs to be properly configured for production
- Compass calibration may be inconsistent on some devices
- Audio playback may fail with slow internet connections

### Future Improvements
- Add caching for Quran audio files
- Implement offline mode for all features
- Add more translation options
- Improve accessibility features
- Add widget tests for critical components
